## Why Do We Need Java Inheritance?

1. code Reusability :- The code written in the Superclass is common to all subclasses. Child classes can directly use the parent class code.

2. Method Overriding :-  Method Overriding is achievable only through Inheritance. It is one of the ways by which Java achieves Run Time Polymorphism.

3. Abstraction :- The concept of abstract where we do not have to provide all details is achieved through inheritance. Abstraction only shows the functionality to the user.


### Important Terminologies Used in Java Inheritance

1. Class
2. Super Class/Parent Class
3. Sub Class/Child Class
4. Reusability

### How to Use Inheritance in Java?

The extends keyword is used for inheritance in Java. Using the extends keyword indicates you are derived from an existing class. In other words, “extends” refers to increased functionality.

In practice, inheritance, and polymorphism are used together in Java to achieve fast performance and readability of code.


### Java Inheritance Types

1. Single Inheritance
2. Multilevel Inheritance
3. Hierarchical Inheritance
4. Multiple Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance
